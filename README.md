# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Car Characteristics

## Project Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze a comprehensive dataset of car characteristics, encompassing a wide range of features that contribute to the overall performance, efficiency, and pricing of various car models. By conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating informative visualizations, the goal is to uncover valuable insights that can inform decision-making for car buyers, manufacturers, and industry stakeholders.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains various features related to car characteristics. Below is a description of the columns in the dataset:

**symboling:** Insurance risk rating of the car, an integer ranging from -3 to 3, where a higher positive value indicates a higher risk rating.

**normalized-losses:** Percentage of the car's value lost due to depreciation.

**make:** Manufacturer or brand of the car.

**fuel-type:** Type of fuel used by the car (e.g., gas or diesel).

**aspiration:** Engine's air intake system (turbo-charged or naturally aspirated).

**num-of-doors:** Number of doors the car has.

**body-style:** Car's body style (e.g., sedan, hatchback, convertible).

**drive-wheels:** Drive system of the car (e.g., front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive).

**engine-location:** Location of the car's engine (front or rear).

**wheelbase:** Distance between the front and rear axles, measured in inches.

**length:** Overall length of the car, measured in inches.

**width:** Overall width of the car, measured in inches.

**height:** Overall height of the car, measured in inches.

**curb-weight:** Weight of the car including all standard equipment and a full tank of fuel, measured in pounds.

**engine-type:** Type of engine used in the car (e.g., overhead cam, rotary).

**num-of-cylinders:** Number of cylinders in the car's engine.

**engine-size:** Displacement of the car's engine, measured in cubic centimeters (cc).

**fuel-system:** Type of fuel system used in the car (e.g., electronic fuel injection, carburetor).

**bore:** Diameter of the engine's cylinders, measured in millimeters.

**stroke:** Distance the piston travels within the engine's cylinders, measured in millimeters.

**compression-ratio:** Ratio of the volume of the engine cylinder from its maximum to minimum volume.

**horsepower:** Maximum power output of the car's engine, measured in horsepower.

**peak-rpm:** Engine speed at which the maximum horsepower is achieved, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM).

**city-mpg:** Car's fuel efficiency in the city, measured in miles per gallon (MPG).

**highway-mpg:** Car's fuel efficiency on the highway, measured in miles per gallon (MPG).

**price:** Price of the car, which is the target variable in this dataset.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. The following Python packages are required:

+  pandas
+  numpy
+  matplotlib
+  seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 

git clone https://github.com/Waliid18/Portfolio.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Waliid18

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Project_1_Exploratory_Data_Analysis and_Visualization_of_Car_Characteristics.ipynb

4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the exploratory data analysis and visualize the car characteristics.

## Summary of Analysis

In this project, we performed an exploratory data analysis on the car characteristics dataset. Key insights include:

+  Visualizations highlighting the relationships between various car features and their impact on car pricing.
+  Analysis of the distribution and correlation of different car attributes.
+  Identification of key factors influencing car performance, efficiency, and pricing.
